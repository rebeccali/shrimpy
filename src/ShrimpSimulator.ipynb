    "## Relevant Equations \n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton-Euler (equations 2.2 and 2.3)\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\dot{v}^I_F} = (\\mathbf{f_{aero}} + m \\mathbf{g} - m \\mathbf{\\omega^{FI} }\\times \\mathbf{v^I_F})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\dot{\\omega}^{FI}} = \\mathbf{I}^{-1}(\\mathbf{\\tau_{aero}} - \\mathbf{\\omega^{FI} }\\times \\mathbf{I\\omega^{BI}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $v_F^I$ is velocity of the center of mass of flyer frame in inertial/world frame\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{\\omega^{FI} } = [p\\ q\\ r]^T$ is the angular velocity of flyer frame w.r.t. inertial\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{\\omega^{BI} }$ is the angular velocity of body frame wrt inertial (same as flyer but with rotation about z axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blade Equations (equations 3.8)\n",
    "$$[v_E^I]^E = \\mathbf{R^E_F}[v^I_F]^F + \\mathbf{R^E_F}[\\omega^{SF}]^F \\times \\mathbf{R^E_F} [S_{EF}]^F + \\mathbf{R^E_F}[\\nu]^F$$\n",

    "* $\\nu$ is the induced inflow velocity (Equation 3.1, thesis p.52)\n",
    "* $[v_E^I]^E$ is the relative wing in the propeller frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euler Angles Convention\n",
    "For euler angles, we are using the `scipy` library of `spatial.transform` with `Rotation`. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html#scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses the capital notation `ZXY` to denote intrinsic rotations, which we will use such that the final rotation is about the rotational axis of the vehicle for readibility. This is such that the first rotation is about the Z axis, or corresponds to the yaw.\n",
    "This matches the MEAM 620 project 1 convention.\n",
    "Additionally, the euler angles are $\\phi, \\theta, \\psi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use the `euler2Rotm` and `rotm2Euler` functions for converting between rotation matricies and euler angle vectors \n",

    "## Code parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* camelCase unless stated otherwise\n",
    "* Underscores for frames or for subscripts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "Flyer frame means that it is *not* in the frame of the propellor with the extra spin on the propellor. This is \n",
    "only relevant for the shaft propellor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the body drag plates, this is all in the body frame (no extra spin) so the euler angular rates are still correct, as well as the euler angles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notation \n",
    "* For angular velocities: $\\omega$ is a 1x3 vector, while $[\\omega]$ is the tensor. We will try to have $[]$ always denote a tensor. \n",
    "* For Rotation Matricies: ${}^A R_B$ denotes a rotation from $B$ to $A$, e.g. $p_A = {}^AR_B p_B$\n",
    "* For position/velocity vectors: ${}^c v_a^b$ denotes a vector from $a$ to $b$ in the $c$ frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: read through the math extra carefully again. \n",
    "Be explicit with the notation and work through each sub example - write an example for\n",
    "that one and the next one."

    "* **The body velocity**. This is simply the velocity of the body frame w.r.t. the world frame in the world frame $^w v_w^b$ rotated to the element frame $^e v_w^b$. \n",

    "${}^b p_b^e = [r \\cos\\kappa,\\ r \\sin\\kappa,\\ h]^T$, where $h$ is the height (z-axis distance) from the cg to the propellor center, $r$ is the radius of the element, and $\\kappa$ is the angle of the propellor with respect to the body x axis. \n",
    "\n",

    "A note on $\\kappa$ for the shaft blade:\n",
    "For the shaft blades, they are spinning at roughly 3-8 revolutions per second. That is just barely fast enough that we should not track the position of each blade to do the calculation, but instead do the integral. TODO. \n",

The rotation from body to element, ${}^e R_b$ is the rotation by the propellor angle.
