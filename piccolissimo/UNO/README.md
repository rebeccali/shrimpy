# UNO Simulator
The UNO simulator was originally developed by Matt Piccoli, now being used for the SHRIMP project.

The simulator has two simple run functions to run a simulation of Piccolissimo V11:
* RunBasicSimulator.m draws a circle with the robot
* RunOptimizeBetaD.m runs OptimizeBetaD which is used to generate an optimized blade shape for UNO.

## Current TODOS:
* Add simulation showing azimuthal angles and body angles
* Rip out globals
* Refactor refactor refactor
