\TODO{UAV increased popularity}
\TODO{Most traditional systems require at least 4 actuators, with multi-copters taking the largest market share.}
\TODO{Mueller looked into controlling these vehicles should an actuator fail. Can control if sacrifice yaw and attitude control bandwidth dependent on body speed. \cite{mueller2014stability}}
\TODO{Extinction by Zhang demonstrates a vehicle \cite{zhang2016controllable}}
\TODO{Though under-actuated, their coupling between attitude and position is straightforward}
\TODO{Ulrich/samara use less than 2 (see references from D'Andrea paper)\cite{ulrich2010falling}}
